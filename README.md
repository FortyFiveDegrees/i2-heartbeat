# i2-heartbeat
Rewrite of Dalk21/i2-heartbeat made using the i2.js library.

A new set of features and capability to the same old concept- basic IntelliStar playlist management.

Added features over Final Release of Scuewer Heartbeat:
* Sidebar Customization (web panel)
* LF delay from loadPresentation (was 20, now can be changed from default of 10)
* More robust backend, removed unneeded things

i2 Heartbeat is built upon [i2.js](https://github.com/FortyFiveDegrees/i2.js). This software is still in beta, so please make any issues/PRs as needed.
